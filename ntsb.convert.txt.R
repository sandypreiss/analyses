# Cleaning and summarizing data from the NTSB Incident database
# Created by Todd Curtis of AirSafe.com (tcurtis@airasfe.com), December 2015
#
# The online accessible NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1982 and later about 
# civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its 
# territories and possessions, and in international waters.
# 
# The database can be accessed at http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx,
# and the results can be downloaded into either an XML file callled AviationData.xml
# or a text file called AviationData.txt.
#
# You must first to to the NTSB database page and specifiy the range of data to be
# downloaded. Then you download it to the hard drive or other location where you will
# also have the R code that you will use to analyze the data.
#
# The online NTSB database allows users to download the output either as a 
# text file or an XML file. The following program takes the XML  version of 
# the output, processes the data to make it suitable for analysis by R, and
# creates a CSV file that can be analyzed by a wide rage of data analysis programs.

# In addition to converting the input file, it provides sevaral example summary 
# statistics concerning the distribution of accidents by geographical area,
# time, and severity of outcomes.

# Step 0:  Load the NTSB output file:
# The NTSB text output has a header with the variable names, and uses the "|" 
# character as the field separator character.

# The following commands removes the field separator character and transforms
# the variable names into ones appropriate for a data frame (replacing any spaces in
# the variable name with a period). 

filename <- "AviationData.txt" 
ntsb.data.raw = read.delim(filename, header=TRUE, sep="|",  quote = "",dec = ".",fill = TRUE, comment.char = "")
ntsb.data = ntsb.data.raw

# DATA CLEANING

# Step 1: Eliminate any columns (variables) added as a consequence of Step 0,
# columbns which have no data (all are NA)
elim.var = which(apply(ntsb.data, 2, function(x) all(is.na(x))))
elim.var = as.data.frame(elim.var) # Column name and column number of this data frame are the columns to be cut

# Eliminates all columns with only NA values
if (nrow(elim.var)>0) ntsb.data = ntsb.data[,-elim.var[,1]] 

# Step 2: Ensure character variables are of type character

# As part of the process, need to ensure that there are not extra spaces
# at the beginning or end of each character value

# ================================
# Use function 'stripper', which works like the str_trim() function in the strigr package  
# Using this function to use only base R package.

stripper <- function(x){
        # This function removes leading and trailing spaces from a vector.
        # Space characters include tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, 
        # carriage return, space.
        # Equivalent to the str_trim() function in the strigr package   
        x = as.character(x)
        x = sub("[[:space:]]+$", "", x) # Remove leading space characters
        x = sub("^[[:space:]]+", "", x) # Remove trailing space characters
        return(x)
}
# ================================

# Find which columns match the following known character vectors
char.vecs = c("Event.Id","Investigation.Type","Accident.Number",       
              "Location", "Country", "Airport.Code", "Airport.Name", "Injury.Severity",
              "Aircraft.Damage", "Aircraft.Category", "Registration.Number", "Make",
              "Model", "Amateur.Built", "Engine.Type", "FAR.Description","Schedule",              
              "Purpose.of.Flight", "Air.Carrier", "Weather.Condition",
              "Broad.Phase.of.Flight", "Report.Status")

char.vecs.ndx = which(colnames(ntsb.data) %in% char.vecs)

# Ensure that the character variable is of type character, then remove extra spaces
for (i in 1:length(char.vecs.ndx)) {
        ntsb.data[,char.vecs.ndx[i]] = as.character(ntsb.data[,char.vecs.ndx[i]])
        ntsb.data[,char.vecs.ndx[i]] = stripper(ntsb.data[,char.vecs.ndx[i]])
}

# Step 3: Ensure numerical variables are of type numeric

# Find which columns match the following known numerical vectors
num.vecs = c("Latitude", "Longitude", "Number.of.Engines", "Total.Fatal.Injuries",  
             "Total.Serious.Injuries", "Total.Minor.Injuries", "Total.Uninjured")

# Creates a vector for the column numbers for numeric variables
num.vecs.ndx = which((colnames(ntsb.data)) %in% num.vecs)

# Note: This step appears to replace missing numeric values with NA
for (i in 1:length(num.vecs.ndx)) {
       ntsb.data[,num.vecs.ndx[i]] = as.numeric(as.character(ntsb.data[,num.vecs.ndx[i]]))
}

# Step 4: Change date variables into a format suitable for R

# Dates are in form mm/dd/YYYY, must convert to a date format of YYYY-mm-dd
# Two date variables, Event.Date and Pulication Date
ntsb.data$Event.Date = as.Date(ntsb.data$Event.Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
ntsb.data$Publication.Date = as.Date(ntsb.data$Publication.Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
# Note: This step appears to replace missing date values with NA

# Now will have separate columns for Year, Month, Day, and Weekday for Event.Date
ntsb.data$Year = as.numeric(format(ntsb.data$Event.Date, "%Y")) # Ensure it is a numeric variable
ntsb.data$Month = months(ntsb.data$Event.Date, abbreviate = TRUE)
ntsb.data$Day = format(ntsb.data$Event.Date, "%d")
ntsb.data$Weekday = weekdays(ntsb.data$Event.Date, abbreviate = TRUE)

# DATA CONVERSION: Ordering days of the week and months of the year 

# Make months and days of the week factors and order them as they are in a calendar
ntsb.data$Month = factor(ntsb.data$Month,levels=c("Jan", "Feb","Mar", "Apr","May",
                                                  "Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct", "Nov","Dec"), ordered=TRUE)

ntsb.data$Weekday = factor(ntsb.data$Weekday,levels=c("Sun","Mon","Tue",
                                                      "Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat"), ordered=TRUE)

# Step 5 Eliminate any rows (records) which has no date (Event.Date is NA)
elim.row = which(is.na(ntsb.data$Event.Date))
if (length(elim.row)>0) ntsb.data = ntsb.data[-elim.row,] # Eliminates all rows with only NA value for Event.Date

# Step 6: Changing blank, "N/A","Unknown", and similar responses to NA

# First, define  a vector of words or phrases that are to be replaced with NA
repl.words = c("", ".", "N/A", "UNK","Unknown","Unavailable")

# Note that the following checks all columns, event non-character one, but in the end,
# only character columns will have any non-zero values for replacement words
repl.list = apply(ntsb.data,2, function(x) which(x %in% repl.words))

# The number of times replacement words occur for each database variable (column), 
# is placed in a one-column data frame where the row names correspond to the 
# variable names the column has the number of times the replacement words occur
with.missing = as.data.frame(sapply(repl.list,length)) 
colnames(with.missing) = "Replacement.Words"

# Identify columns corresponding with character-based
# variables with at least one replacement word
with.missing.ndx = which(with.missing[,1]>0) 

# Replace replacement words with NAs in those columns containing
# one or more replacement words

for(i in 1:length(with.missing.ndx)){
        repl.vector=ntsb.data[,with.missing.ndx[i]]%in%repl.words 
        ntsb.data[repl.vector,with.missing.ndx[i]]=NA
} 


# Step 7: Specify city name, state abbreviation, and full state name
# for any location in the United states

# Will focus only on rows with a US city address entered, implying the following is true
# ntsb.data$Location is not NA and ntsb.data$Country=="United States"
city.locs = !(is.na(ntsb.data$Location)) & ntsb.data$Country=="United States"
# The following are the locations in the vector where this is true
city.locs.ndx = which(city.locs) 

# STATE CODES: Before adding full state names to data frame, must match
# two-letter state codes with full state names.

# First, create a vector of full state names by agmenting the built-in R 
# lists of names and abbreviations of the 50 states (state.name and state.abb) 
# with all other names and two-letter abbreviations used by the US Postal Service (USPS)

# Source is USPS Publication 28 - postal addressing standards 
# Located at http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm accessed 9 December 2015

extra.abb = c("AS", "DC", "FM","GU","MH", "MP", "PW", "PR", "VI", "GM", "AO","PO")
extra.name = c("American Samoa", "District of Columbia", "Federated States of Micronesia",
               "Guam", "Marshall Islands", "Northern Mariana Islands", "Palau",
               "Puerto Rico", "Virgin Islands", "Gulf of Mexico", "Atlantic Ocean",

# Now append them to the R-provided list of 50 state names and abbreviations
usps.abb = c(state.abb,extra.abb)
usps.state = c(state.name,extra.name)

# Next is to identify the number of commas in city identifiers
# This is because the NTSB output did not have separate variable for state
# States in NTSB output are two letter codes preceeded by a comma and a space

# These three vectors each initialized with a number of NA values equal to the
# number of rows to ensure that the final vector will be compatible with ntsb.data
comma.pos = rep(NA,nrow(ntsb.data)) # start with NA for number of commas for all Locations
city.vec = rep(NA,nrow(ntsb.data))
state.vec = rep(NA,nrow(ntsb.data))

for(x in 1:length(city.locs.ndx)){

        comma.pos.vec = comma.pos.list[[1]] # Vector of comma positinos
        comma.pos[x] = comma.pos.vec[length(comma.pos.vec)]
        
        # Get the length of the Location field character string
        num.chars = nchar(ntsb.data$Location[city.locs.ndx[x]]) 

        # Determine state code if location has enough characters for comma, space, and code
        if(comma.pos[x] >= 1 & num.chars >= 4){
                # Use last comma position to determine where split character string and find state code
                city.vec[city.locs.ndx[x]] =  substr(ntsb.data$Location[city.locs.ndx[x]], 1,(comma.pos[x]-1)) 
                state.vec[city.locs.ndx[x]] =  substr(ntsb.data$Location[city.locs.ndx[x]], (comma.pos[x]+2),num.chars)       
        } # End of if statement for creating city name and state abbreviation

} # End of process for finding US city names and state abbreviations     


# Initialize the full state name vector with a number of NA values equal to the
# number of rows to ensure that the final vector will be compatible with ntsb.data
state.full=rep(NA,nrow(ntsb.data))

for (i in 1:length(city.locs.ndx)){
        if(state.vec[i] %in% usps.abb) {
                state.full[i]=usps.state[grep(state.vec[i], usps.abb)]
        }
        # Erase city and two-letter state code if state code is not in usps.abb list
        if(!(state.vec[i] %in% usps.abb)) {
                city.vec[i]=NA
                state.vec[i]=NA
        }
}

# Can now add city and state abbrevications, and full state names to data frame
ntsb.data$City=city.vec
ntsb.data$State.code=state.vec
ntsb.data$State=state.full

# Step 8: Arrange the new columns in logical groupings
